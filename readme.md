## Serdar SARIOGLU GitHub Repository

Welcome IT Guys (System Admins - DevOps - SecOps - Cloudiers) Information Technology projects are being more complicated every day. However, don't worry, Infrastructure Designing and IT Management is what I do best.

My name is Serdar Sarioglu, and I am a Senior IT Architect & Security Manager with more than ten yearsâ€™ making Infrastructures Efficient and Secure! I have completed high and mid-level projects (mostly ERP and now Cloud) on time and improved IT operations! After entirely technical years I am now able to understand IT requirements, make project plans and reduce costs!
