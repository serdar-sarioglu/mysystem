Sample: You are in an internal network and you want to understand which ports are open from inside to outside.

Try to go to --> http://portquiz.net:4444/
4444 is your test port


To Detect all open ports: 
1.) Create a bash file (example open_ports.sh)
  
      #!/bin/bash
      port=1
      while [ $port -le 65535 ]
      do
      nc -z -v  portquiz.net $port
      ((port++))
      done

2.) chmod 777 open_ports.sh
3.) run --> ./open_ports.sh
